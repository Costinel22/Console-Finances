for point 1
The total number of months included in the dataset
- calculate totale number of mounths   
create a variabile and add lenght to it
  var totalMounths = finances.lenght;

for point 2 
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- create tow variabile
   var totalProfitLosses = 0
   var record 
create a for instance to check if the finance are number and calculate the sum of the profit/losts over the whole period
   totalProfitLosses += record[number from finance array ]
     using += to calculate the total amount of array

for point 3
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- create four variabile
  var changes 
  var totalChanges = 0
  var previousProfitLoss = 0
  var countChange = 0
  var curentPreviousLoss = 0
  var averageChange = 0
  add all on  for of loop

fot point 4
The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
- create variable for each change biger and lower
   var greatestIncrease
   var greatestDecrease



for point 5 print result using 
console.log(totalMounths)
console.log(, "$" + totalProfitLosses)
console.log("Greatest increase in Profit/Loss );
console.log("Greatest decrease in Profit/Loss);
